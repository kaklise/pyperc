pyperc
=======================================

pyperc is a Python package for invasion percolation which models multiphase fluid migration in porous 
media.  The model accounts for capillary pressure, buoyancy, and gravity.  A tuning parameter can be 
set to adjust the stochastic nature of the process.  Model equations are from [1,2]. 

The software contains a single class, `pyperc.model.InvasionPercolation`, which is used to complete the following steps:

1. Define the regular or irregularly structured pore network including the x,y,z location of pores, connectivity 
   between pores, and pore radius. The pore network can be defined using a regularly spaced grid 
   (see [3D regular grid example](examples/grid_example.py))
   or using pore and throat files (see [3D irregular grid example](examples/network_example.py)).
2. Initialize the pore network with contact angles, invading fluid density, defending fluid density, and surface tension. 
   The user can also specify custom start and end location used to track fluid migration and the initial condition of occupied pores.
3. Run invasion percolation and specify the maximum number of iterations, stochastic selection parameter, and random seed.

Additionally, the software contains a graphics module, `pyperc.graphics` which contains a function to plot 3D pore 
network models using plotly. matplotlib can be used to create simple 2D graphics using imshow.

Examples
-----------
The software contains several examples. In the examples, the user can modify input 
parameters, including the stochastic selection process and density 
difference, to explore a range percolation processes:

All units are SI:

* Length = m
* Time = s
* Mass = kg
* Pressure = Pa
* Force = N
